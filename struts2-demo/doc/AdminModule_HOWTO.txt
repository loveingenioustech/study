Admin Module
============

0. Stop your apache instance.  (if you don't the admin program below will give 
   you database contention errors; this is a derby limitation.)
1. Pull down all the current source from SVN and compile it with the build.xml 
   at the top level.
2. Go to the dist directory.  You should now see a JAR as well as a WAR file.  
   Copy the bookmanager-admin.jar to the bin directory of apache.
3. cd to the apache bin directory for the next four tasks.
4. Remove the existing derby database with an rm -r booklook/
5. Create the new database schema and add a user by typing 
   "java -jar admin.jar adduser admin admin admin" 
   (or whatever you want to use as a login/pw for the first two 
   "admins" but make sure the third one is "admin" as this is the user type).
6. Create a non-admin user by typing "java -jar admin.jar adduser user user user"
   (again, whatever you want to use, and the user type isn't really checked if 
   it's not 'admin' so you can use what you want for that, also)
7. Start your apache instance.
8. Log in with one of your two users.  If you use the admin login, you should get
   the "add" item as well as the "list" item.  The other user should just get "list."
9. You can also try logging in with an invalid user.  This should return you to the 
   login screen with a message that your username or pw are incorrect.
10. The admin program also has a "listusers" which you can run if apache isn't 
    running. Just type "java -jar admin.jar listusers" to see the login, 
    SHA-encrypted PW, and usertype for each user.
